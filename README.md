## Why this exists

Prediction markets are processing **$18B+ in monthly trading volume** — and 66% of that demand comes from outside the US, without a single local operator to capture it.

Kalshi (CFTC-regulated, 200x annual volume growth) just signed its **first international brokerage deal** with XP Inc. — Brazil's largest investment platform with 4.7M clients. Their co-founder put it plainly:

> *"It makes sense for us to go through these international partners. They already have the customers and the brand."*
> — Luana Lopes Lara, co-founder & COO, Kalshi · [Bloomberg, March 2026](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-03-09/kalshi-teams-up-with-brazil-s-xp-for-first-international-push)

Kalshi can do that one deal at a time. Kuest makes the same capability available to any operator — without a bilateral negotiation.

**Kuest is the infrastructure layer.** You bring the brand and audience. We handle the rest.

> **Why Polygon + Polymarket-derived contracts?**
> Most prediction market liquidity already lives here. Existing bots, market makers, and USDC balances are already in this environment. Smart contracts are derived from Polymarket's audited CLOB architecture and adapted to support shared liquidity across multiple operator frontends.

| **Financial media & news groups** | Turn your audience's market conviction into a tradeable product. Embed live markets. Earn fees instead of running ads. |
| **Fintech & neobrokers** | Differentiate with an instrument your competitors don't offer. First mover in your market. |
