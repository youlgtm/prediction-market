# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We welcome all forms of contribution including bug reports, feature requests, documentation improvements, and code contributions.

## Reporting Issues

Before creating a new issue, please check if it already exists. When reporting bugs, please use the [Bug report option](https://github.com/kuestcom/prediction-market/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml).

## Feature Requests

For new features, [open a discussion](https://github.com/orgs/kuestcom/discussions) describing:

- What problem the feature solves
- How it should work
- Examples or mockups if applicable

Please check if a similar request already exists.

## Pull Requests

For code contributions:

- Open an issue first for major changes.
- One PR must address only one feature or one bugfix.
- Keep PRs small, focused, and easy to review.
- Follow existing code style and conventions.
- Use commit prefixes such as `fix:`, `feat:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, and `style:`.
- Use English for branch names and commit subjects.
- Review your own diff before opening the PR.
- Rebase on the latest `main` before pushing. Do not merge `main` into your branch.
- Run `bun run lint`, `bun run fmt`, `bun run test`, and `bun run build` before submitting.
- If dependencies changed, include the updated `bun.lock`.
- Avoid unrelated refactors, drive-by fixes, or config/policy changes in the same PR.
- Avoid commented-out code and unnecessary inline comments. Keep comments only when they explain non-obvious constraints or decisions.
- If you use AI/LLM tools, use the highest reasoning mode available and full repository context/access when safe, then manually review and test the final diff before submitting. Examples: OpenAI/Codex `xhigh`; Claude extended thinking with the highest available thinking budget.
- Bugfix PRs should include a regression test whenever feasible.
- PR descriptions should clearly state scope, reason for the change, testing performed, and any relevant risks.

### Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Use Bun 1.4.2
3. Install dependencies: `bun install`
4. Create a branch using the appropriate prefix, for example `feat/name-in-english` or `fix/name-in-english`
5. Make your changes
6. Review your diff before opening the PR
7. Run `bun run lint`, `bun run fmt`, `bun run test`, and `bun run build`
8. Rebase on the latest `main`
9. Commit and push to your fork
10. Open a pull request with a clear description

### Code Quality

- `bun run lint` applies safe lint fixes.
- `bun run fmt` formats supported files with Oxfmt.
